2000-01-17,"Dear Mr. Krishna - If it is convenient for you, Dr. Lay is suggesting that you meet on Friday, January 28 at 3:45 p.m. at the Hotel Meierhof. Dr. Lay will meet you in the lobby and you can meet at a table in the restaurant at the hotel. Please advise if this works with your schedule. Rosalee"
2000-01-18,"Dear Mr. Misaki: Dr. Lay would prefer that the pre-meeting continue to be scheduled at 8:30 a.m. on January 29, as he has conflicts the afternoon of January 28, so it would be difficult for him to attend. Please advise. Rosalee Fleming"
2000-01-19,"Sanjay - Further to my earlier message, Ken is very willing to go to the Chief Minister's hotel to meet with him. Rosie"
2000-01-20,Not interested
2000-01-26,Hi Liz - Will you please give your Dad a call at the office at your earliest convenience. Rosie
2000-01-27,"Hi Liz - The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their preference. They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their family. They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the Vittors have. Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on the 3rd or 4th floor. They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view on the North side. If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as quiet. The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths. They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow. The Hotel Meierhof's phone number is: 41-81-416-82-85, Fax is: 41-81-416-39-82. They should arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m. I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!! Thank you so much for including me on the Save the Date list. I feel honored! Unfortunately, we won't be able to come. Our ""first"" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!! Take care and call if we can do anything. Rosie"
2000-02-01,Mr. Straszheim - Mr. Lay did receive your e-mail - per your telephone call to us last evening. Rosalee
2000-02-02,It's done!!
2000-02-08,"Joe, I am probably really missing something on this, but I can't determine when the big OECD Forum is. Rosie"
2000-02-08,"Hi Liz - You e-mail worked perfectly. I was going into the board meeting when it was received, so sorry I didn't respond. Your Dad hasn't seen your message yet, but hopefully he can call this afternoon. I hope that works for you. He is leaving early this afternoon as he and Linda have an appointment at 4:30. Rosie"
2000-02-09,Hi Liz - Your Dad said to tell you that it would be fine for Elizabeth to review the document. Her secretary told me that her e-mail address is: elabano@enron.com. I'm copying her on this in case you have any difficulty with sending it. Rosie
2000-02-12,"Russell, I think it will be Kenneth.Lay@Enron.com. Do we capitalize all the words, but com? I noticed that mine is Rosalee.Fleming@Enron.com. I had sent something to my home e-mail address. This may not be a good test as I am sending it from my home computer, from his mail-box, but not from his computer. Oh, well, we'll see!! Rosie"
2000-02-17,"Barbara, I have advised our Washington office that Mr. Lay will be on this conference call at 3:30. Just let us know the number for him to call. Thank you. Dorothy"

2000-02-29,"Hi Rebecca - In fact, the Consul General of Ghana, Jack Webb, has called Ken asking him to meet with the Ambassador to Ghana March 10 or 11 when he will be in Houston. I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he sees your message. Rosie"
2000-02-29,"Rebecca, I just talked to Ken and asked him again. He said that there had been a couple of developments while he was in London, so he wanted to wait until he gets back to the office and has a chance to talk to you. He will be in the office on Thursday. Thanks. Rosie"
2000-02-29,"Mr. Platt - Ken Lay said that he will approve the $10,000 underwriter costs to be one of the five sponsors for the media briefing on March 14. Mr. Lay has asked me to see if Joe Sutton, the Vice Chairman of Enron, might be able to attend. I will pass the information on to him.

Are there specific things that Ken needs to be briefed on? I know that Steve did recommend that Ken have this meeting. Thanks very much. Rosie"
2000-03-08,"Sherri, I'm sorry I have been sending your e-mails to the ""old"" name. I didn't realize it had been changed, but this is so right and very good! Rosie"
2000-04-03,"Hi Terry - Ken Lay said that he would really like an update and more detail about the ""Digital Divide"" and TFA. He is attending the Fortune Battle Royal and said this fits right in with the subject. He will be leaving for Washington tomorrow night. Thanks. Rosalee"

2000-04-07,"Yes, indeed."
2000-04-11,"Hi Liz - Your Father wrote: ""Elizabeth - The Republican Convention is July 31 - August 3. Although there are no guarantees I expect I can get you tickets and reservations. Love, Dad"" Liz, I have sent an e-mail to our Washington office to ask for assistance in obtaining hotel reservations and credentials. We don't yet have reservations for Ken as everything is locked up by the Republicans, but I have been assured they will be forthcoming. We asked for the same hotel as your Dad will have, so hopefully that will work. Rosie"

2000-04-14,"Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie - We have been working on Ken's schedule. It is a fairly busy week, but it looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New York time), if that is still good for you. Please let me know if Wednesday is a satisfactory time for the phone call. That appears to be the only window he has next week.

2000-06-13,"Hello Janice: I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad. It sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly. These are always difficult times. As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives. But we can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege to have been raised in such loving homes. Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU. He is joining an excellent company. I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA. As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can. As to our family, within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina. They met while they were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires. They're currently on their honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to Miami, Florida. This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born. It was born to our son David and his wife Courtney. It was a 7 lb., 10 oz., 20 inch little boy. So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days. They are a great deal of fun. We are doing quite well. I am looking forward to seeing Ginger ""Rees"" Copeland when she comes to Houston. I would be delighted to arrange tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit Houston. I hope you have a great summer."
2000-06-16,"As we discussed, the date that Ken thinks is best for the United Way Kick-off is August 9 at the conclusion of the Employee Meeting. He thinks it would be fine to do the presentations there and then move on to whatever activity is planned. Thanks for everyone's patience. Rosie"
2000-06-20,"On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in Houston. For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing. MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area. MEC represents the frontier of computing technology. I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an industry. I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25 from 11:30 to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

This year's keynote sessio= n=20 is entitled ""The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and opportunity in the= =20 electronic energy marketplace"". This session has no bullet points as I wou= ld=20 like the speaker to address only the latest issues as they see fit. My=20 research has showed that the industry is very interested in your opinions = on=20 this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into you busy= =20 schedule. =01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look at the latest adva= nces=20 being made in the energy market=01,s systems and technologies.

If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please let= =20 me know; any help would be gratefully received.

2000-07-10,Hi Mrs. Vittor - Your Dad just asked if you had sent an e-mail where you are staying in Miami. Rosie
2000-07-10,"Sarah, Cindy Olson requested that I forward this to you for further handling. Rosalee ---------------------- Forwarded by Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron on 07/10/2000 08:59 AM --------------------------- Betty Alexander@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 07/07/2000 06:37 PM To: Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: OK, Jeff, you requested that we be candid about Enron... ""Management does things right; Leadership does the right things."" (Peter Drucker) Today I began to wonder if I've been a fool in staunchly defending Enron's Visions & Values. An esteemed colleague of very strong professional reputation at Enron was recently approached by a hiring supervisor. Totally unexpected & unsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good feedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt. But after a short time, suddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory. No specific behaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to modify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to find another job. Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), ""I want avoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget this."" To date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about Enron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, and there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique. I refer here to Cindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office. I don't care why it was decided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when things go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented professional more time. She writes: ...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in which to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting. I had 2 interviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself. I've not received answers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without acknowledgment of any sort. I have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened to them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 months to land her present job. I am not afforded that opportunity now ... Jeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline? There are no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & discreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from HR. With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line with Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people. Cindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to honor her wishes with silence. But you must see the irony here, not to mention the double standard in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to assistants all over Enron: Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put out of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert! I'm not blaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example. I remember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting: ""believing your own baloney."" He wasn't talking about Visions & Values then, but ""believing baloney"" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron. You asked for candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you. Jeff, thanks for asking and listening. I and my colleagues are listening too, but seeing is believing. Respectfully submitted, Betty Alexander Sr. Administrative Assistant "

The deal with Blockbuster has been a great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities. I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden. It looks quite informative and interesting. Sweden is also an excellent place for a summer conference. The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste Roberts at (713) 853-0555. If he would also copy me on the letter to Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully considered. I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current time. I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too distant future. Warm regards, Ken"
2000-08-03,"Letter dictated by Ken Lay Gene: I appreciated the update on your health status. It appears you are taking a very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the world, setting about to turn it around. I'm sure it goes without saying that you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome. Clearly your health is the number one issue now. To the extent you want to work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office. But that is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your health that can be done. If there is any way I or Enron can be of any further help, please let me know. Ken "

We invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this event. Our theme is ""2001: An Energy Odyssey."" We are using the conference to showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as enterprise strategy and metamorphosis. We can think of no one better to clearly define these major themes and priorities than you. I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t= o heart). The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members. We would ask you to include comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in markets on behalf of enterprises. The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an= d university interests engaged in energy development and policy. To bring yo= u up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc= e (at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas. Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project, which you helped to found. Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel= p identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary session, ""Sustaining Development"" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn thinking around with our re-phrasing). I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability. We look forward to having you with us next April!

I have received information from the Control Risks Group that several anti-capitalist and anarchist groups are planning major demonstrations to disrupt the proceedings. Like the earlier incidents in Seattle, large-scale clashes between demonstrators and police are expected. If you or any of your staff members are planning to attend, you might want to consider your personal security when making hotel and local travel accomodations. Corporate Security can provide local personal security agents if you desire. Any non-essential travel to Melbourne during this time frame should be rescheduled. Regards, Mike Hicks"

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took= a=20 step in the right direction. Utility stand-by charges have always been=20 designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20 monopoly prices from customers, or both. But there is no reason to limit t= he=20 elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20 1MW. These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for= =20 California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc= e=20 the risk of black outs this summer. We would propose lifting the cap by=20 offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o= f=20 distributed generation. =20 Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20 investor-owned and municipal utilities Solution: The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is = a=20 step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20 interconnection studies within 7 days. California should ensure that this= =20 requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20 generation. In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when= =20 interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome= =20 through executive orders or other regulations. To the greatest extent=20 possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th= e=20 utility and place that control with the California ISO. This could be=20 accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase= =20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20 Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward. Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20 charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power. From our= =20 analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20 California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California. = As=20 such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat= es=20 adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases. Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018 On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases. Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs. Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs. Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power. Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20 We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues. We have identified three options: Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases. This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X. (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.) Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement. However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix. We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option. (See attached file entitled,=20 =01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018) Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR. Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral. DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR= =20 prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through= =20 contract amendments. 4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001 Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20 Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports= =20 showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance. They diffe= r=20 only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available. Al= l=20 credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer= =20 of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20 likely. =20 CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20 summer by approximately 5,000 MW. These numbers are in line with our=20 estimates. California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,= well=20 below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio= n=20 in the West. Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power= =20 than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20 unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t= o=20 date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t= he=20 flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20 California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to = this=20 requirement. =20 Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early= =20 draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve= re=20 supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced= =20 number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20 utilities. Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren= t=20 pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be= =20 added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest. CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of= =20 rolling black outs this summer. The CEC paints a considerably more=20 optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000= =20 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand. It is our view that California= =20 should view the CEC's ""rosy scenario"" with considerable skepticism. 5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California= =01,s=20 Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution. We wil= l=20 deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing= =20 bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals. As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20 crisis must focus on four issues: Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher) To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. = =20 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less= =20 than a year. In California, it takes about six years, or longer. The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi= slation=20 are steps in the right direction. Our suggested amendments can improve tho= se=20 efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face= =20 in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20 requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements. Enron=01,s= =20 proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20 transfering credits between air districts. In addition, it creates an=20 innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20 emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a= ir=20 districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20 required reductions in pollution emissions. Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle: AB31X (Wright) Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing= =20 the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the= =20 best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer. This can be accomplished mo= st=20 effectively and quickly in two ways: Buy-down demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun= d=20 to finance DWR=01,s power purchases. California could likely reduce demand= more=20 economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou= ld=20 be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,= =20 through the summer months). DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20 determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions. To=20 participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20 necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20 reductions. Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D= eal=20 Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort. Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements: An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price= =20 for hour-ahead power in real time.=20 Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment= =20 verification. Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be= =20 paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018). The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ= e: =01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti= cularly=20 in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation= =20 resources. reduction of peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20 electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity = in=20 the state. fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris= k=20 of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20 customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for= =20 responding.=20 We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in= =20 excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for= =20 summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW. We further estimate= =20 that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time= s=20 that amount. We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20 directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20 control systems that would support load curtailment implementation. Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi= cle:=20 SB27X The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we= re=20 customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy= =20 service providers. Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from= =20 customers and businesses. It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th= e=20 prohibition against Direct Access. Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a= =20 direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o= f=20 Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from= =20 customer migration. =20 In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when= =20 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function. Procureme= nt=20 is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20 condition in which the utilities now find themselves.

Francis Tsegah said radio in particular played a significant part in ensuring the success of the election - Ghana's first multi-party one. He said: ""The press covered the parties and were able to send information to the public in such a way that by the time you had the election there was no longer any question of the media being biased towards one party."" The election was won by opposition candidate John Kufuor. Want more?

Prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said of Malaysiakini: ""People who love Malaysia would not support Malaysiakini. Previously people would say traitors but these people really behave like traitors, asking foreigners to harm their own country."" Two Asiaweek issues and one of FEER - all carrying articles on Malaysia - were stuck in distributions depots, and FEER Managing Editor Michael Vatikiotis said: ""We have no indication as to whether this is just a one off or part of a policy. We have had no official communication."" Asiaweek is part of the AOL-Time Warner stable, and FEER part of Dow Jones. Want more?

Information and Arts Minister Lee Yock Suan said he was set to introduce a bill that would allow the government to restrict distribution of a broadcast service if the company was deemed to be meddling in the city-state's internal affairs. Singapore's Newspaper Act can ban distribution of a newspaper or magazine and has been used against The Economist and Asian Wall Street Journal, but up until now broadcasters have been left alone. Lee said foreign media operated in Singapore as a matter of privilege, not of right. He added: ""Our aim is not to ban information but to restrict subscriber and advertising revenue to an errant channel."" Want more?

Shier said that by June 2003, the ABC wanted to increase its non-news/current affairs production in centres other than Sydney or Melbourne by 40 percent. He also said that the internet had its place within media and should not be sidelined just because of the recent dot com gloom. Unions claim that the decentralisation talk is just a ""stalking horse for getting rid of staff"". Want more?

According to the Times newspaper, the Corporation has also offered Ware personal protection. The bomb blast outside the BBC's west London centre is being blamed on the Real IRA, who may have acted in revenge over the Panorama reports. Meanwhile, speculation that the BBC might move flagship current affairs programme Panorama back to a weekday slot - but on BBC2 - refuses to go away. MediaGuardian quotes an 'insider' as saying: ""Sunday may just have been a transition. If it moved to a weekday slot, possibly even to BBC2, it would increase its audience and get more share."" The BBC has insisted that Panorama will remain in its Sunday night slot, despite opposition from some prominent figures, including Ware. Want more?

The front cover image and photographs inside the magazine, where decapitated bodies were shown, were blacked out by hand in all copies being sent to Indonesia. The distributor said it had not come under pressure from the government to censor the pictures. Time journalist Jason Tedjasukmana said he was concerned that the move could lead to other companies taking censorship into their own hands. Want more?

The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings, transportation, and industry could account for more than half of the potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas technologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an= d power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant emissions. And ""low-carbon energy systems,"" such as renewable energy, can also make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the finding that there is ""no single path to a low emission future.""

The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a series of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden costs, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from operating efficiently. SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of this gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through improved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee= d in the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th= e development of a broadly based energy service industry.

This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more than are built in 42 states. One of the main reasons for adopting the code is the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the Texas state plan for controlling smog. Since the IECC contains a new standard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin= g energy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that serve the air conditioning load. The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th= e Texas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG staff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc= e Project and Alliance Associates. -------------------------------- Alliance Associates Honored with Awards Many Alliance Associates were honored at the 2001 Energy Star Awards Ceremony, hosted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.

Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year. We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio. One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager . (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.) The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd. The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers. Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May. We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting. I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

2001-04-30,"Hi Mary Hope - Ken would like to have the meeting late afternoon on May 24th, if possible. He thinks your suggestion of Steering Committee members to join the meeting are great. Thanks. Rosie"
2001-04-30,"Good morning, Mike. What time is the meeting? Rosie To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: EGM - all company meeting Ken, Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency. The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM. This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 500 people. We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months. I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability. We had a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin. That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000. Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact. If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff. Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance. Mike "
2001-04-30,"Any response to this e-mail should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com Dear Stuart: I appreciate the e-mail concerning the Board of Trustees for The Institute for Advanced Study in Musical Theatre. You do indeed have a very impressive board. I am still thinking about the possibility of serving on your board. But at the earliest, it would be late this year before I could entertain any involvement. With your indulgence, I will keep you advised. Warm regards, Ken"
2001-04-30,"All responses to this e-mail should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com Dear Colette: In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign investment. As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra and the Government of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project. We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the not too distant future. Again, I believe this will send a very negative signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies investing in India. I would think you might want to build one panel around this subject. If there's any way we can be of help, let me know. Best regards, Ken Lay"
2001-05-01,All responses to Ken Lay should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com Roger: I appreciate the brief e-mail concerning The Continental article. It turned out to be a nice article. I have been in and out of London in recent weeks but not there for any extended stay. I believe my next extended stay in London will be this Fall. I will attempt to come by and check your products out. My very best to you. Ken
2001-05-01,"All responses to Ken Lay should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com Dear Steve: The Galleo mobile multimedia communicator looks very interesting. As you may know, I am on the Compaq Computer board. They have a very successful product that is somewhat similar referred to as the iPAQ. They also have other wireless machines which I use. I think for the time being I do not necessarily need to add one more. But I do appreciate you thinking of me. Ken"

2001-05-11,"Oh, Gabriella (that is such a pretty name!) - I apologize for not responding. The conference details have been a bit confusing to us as we didn't seem to have many. Mr. Lay is scheduled to participate in a Ministerial Working Dinner the evening of May 15. He has to give a brief report on his forum session from earlier in the afternoon. It is being held at the Kleber International Conference Centre. Therefore, Dr. and Mrs. Lay will not be able to attend. Thank you. Rosalee"
